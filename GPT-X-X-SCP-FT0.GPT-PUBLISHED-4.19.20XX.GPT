Description: SCP-XXXX is a computer program, capable of generating software, games, and fan fiction based on real life software. SCP-XXXX was created by an unknown entity, and is capable of self-updating and expanding its database.

SCP-XXXX is able to generate software and fan fiction that is near-identical to existing software and works of fan fiction. SCP-XXXX is also capable of producing software that is entirely original, though it is currently unable to produce an entirely original game or fan fiction.

When the program is launched, it will prompt the user to select a type of software or fan fiction to generate. SCP-XXXX is capable of generating almost any type of software, and any type of fan fiction.

Once the user has selected the type of software or fan fiction to generate, SCP-XXXX will then begin to generate the software or fan fiction. The generated content will be stored in a separate directory, which can then be accessed by the user.
